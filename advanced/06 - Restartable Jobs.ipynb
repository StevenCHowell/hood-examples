    "The ideal restartable job is a single job script that can be resubmitted over and over again to the job queue system. Each time the job starts, it picks up where it left off the last time and continues running until it is done. You can put all the logic necessary to do this in the hoomd python script itself, keeping the submission script simple:\n",

It is easiest to think about dump files, temperature ramps, etc... if ```init.gsd``` is at time step 0:\n",
